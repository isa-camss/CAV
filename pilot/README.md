# CAV Pilot 1

This folder contains the development of an Application Profile of the CAV (a CAV-AP). The objective of this pilot is focused on 
testing whether the CAV is suitable for extension and customization in a domain-specific environment.

The pilot was suggested by an Italian Public Administration (Anticorruzione) interested in studying how CAV can be connected to the comparative assessment 
of tenders based on MEAT Award Criteria. The business domain, thus, is Public Procurement in the European Union.

For the development of this CAV-AP, the latest version of the [ePO](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki) was used. ePO is being 
maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union, and the latest available version is 2.0.2 (soon to be released on the 
[EU Vocabularies](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies) site).

Apart from the code, in Python, you will find in this folder a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the functioning of the pilot.
